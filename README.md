+ 01_sim.R 

This file runs a basic simulation, varying effect of race on the outcome (direct path), class origins on the outcome (indirect path), and the degree of determinism in the world. Simulation explores implications for racial inequality (description and explanation)

+ 02_nlsy.R

This file explores some basic data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The idea is that this survey gives us info on origins (income during childhood), race, and various kinds of outcomes (material well-being, respect, etc.) which we might use to say something empirical about which paths are more/less important.
